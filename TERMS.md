### 2. Description of Service
Picture Police is an automated moderation tool designed to identify potential content theft by performing reverse image searches using the Google Cloud Vision API.

### 3. User Limitations & Accuracy
* **No Guarantee of Accuracy:** The App is a decision-support tool. We do not guarantee 100% accuracy in image matching, confidence scores, or "Original Content" (OC) verification. 
* **Moderator Responsibility:** Moderators are solely responsible for any final enforcement actions taken (such as post removals or user bans). The App's automated actions are configurable and should be monitored.

### 4. API Usage
The App relies on the Google Cloud Vision API and the Reddit Developer Platform (Devvit). Service availability is subject to the uptime of these third-party providers.

### 5. Termination
The developer reserves the right to update, deprecate, or disable the App at any time. Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.

### 6. Contact
